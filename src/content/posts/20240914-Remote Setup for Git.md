## Scenario 1 | Local Already Exist
### Initial Setup 
1. `init` the repository on the local machine.
2. Do the initial commits by using
	```bash
	echo "Hello" > myfile.txt
	git add .
	git commit -m "Added myfile.txt"
	```
3. Create a new repository on GitHub, let say "`momo`"
4. Copy its git URL: `https://github.com/<username>/momo.git` 
5. On local machine, setup a new remote alias by using following commands:
	```bash
	# for setting up remote, also the 'origin' alias can be name whatever you want.
	git remote add origin <GIT URL>
	# for pushing the codes into that repo afterwards
	git push orgin main 
	# for pulling changes from remote
	git pull origin main or <branch name>
	```
### Working with branches üå≥
The workflow that I am followed was something like that:
- Don't touch main branch.
- Work on `feature` branch or maybe call it `coding` branch. 
- Its basically a two branch system, where I code on sub-branch while keep merging features time to time in the main branch.

#### Steps I did üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1. Create a new branch: `$ git checkout branch -b coding`
2. Switch to `coding`: `$ git checkout branch coding`
3. Edit files and add commits.
4. Push to remote repo: `$ git push origin <GIT URL> coding`
5. It asked me to compare and pull it to main. I just followed whatever option GitHub gave me, cuz I still don't know how the merging and pulling works. üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
6. Voila! features added to my main repo at remote. ‚ö°

I searched upon internet and found out what if someone made changes to the main repository and if I want to sync my local branch up-to-date, I need to set an upstream for my branch, so what I used is this command: `
```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main coding
# then whenever I wanted to get updates from my main repo at github, I just run this.
git pull --rebase
```
I don't know the reason but sometimes I need to create pull requests manually by going to my branch `coding`

**Also some other useful command (just for me to remember):**
- `git init` : to initialize
- `git add . || git add *` : to add files to staging area
- `git status` : to check what's been staged
- `git commit -m "message"` : to commit
- `git branch -m <old name> <new name>` : to rename a branch
- `git branch -a` : to see all the branch in current repo.
- `git branch -D <branch name>` : to delete a branch
- `git log --graph` : to see commits as in graphical way
- `git diff <commitid1> <commitid2>` : to see changes b/w two commits
- `gti diff <file name>` : to see what changes were made since last commit.
